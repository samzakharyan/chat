I made all more easy. You can just 
1. edit .env file for database information
2. run this commang in the terminal "php artisan migrate"
3. run this commang in the terminal "laravel-echo-server init" and configure laravel-echo-server" OR  just edit laravel-echo-server.json from root directory
4. install and run redis server 
7. run this command in the terminal "laravel-echo-server  start"
8. and this commant "php artisan serv"
